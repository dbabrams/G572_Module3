    "The McHenry County Water Resource Specialist is looking for new ways to view data that is being collected by the county. The USGS is currently collecting data in real-time for a number of wells in McHenry County. Your task in this assignment is to create a potentiometric surface, in real-time, of this data, as well as to look at a surface from summer of 2019 and compare the differences. <b>The wells you will be using for this assignment can be found in the Excel file 'gwmchenry_deep.xlsx'. The files contains columns that (respectively) contain USGS Site Number, Site Name, and Land Surface Elevation.</b>\n",
